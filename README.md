# Button_Biology

## Project Purpose
Use Javascript to create data visualizations that are attractive, accessible, and interactive. Use Plotly (a javascript visualization library). Manipulate, parse, and transform data. Create buttons, drop down menus, and retrieve data from external sources like csv files and APIs. Deploy a polished data visual to the web. 

Create a panel for demographic information then create a way to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer easily on the cloud. Viewers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species found in the volunteers. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. 

## Results
* Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
* Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
* Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
* Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

## Summary
The project was designed to demonstrate the use of Javascript, Plotly, D3.js and Bootstrap. The source data describes bacterial cultures sampled from 153 volunteers. Test subjects may chose a test subject's ID number from a dropdown menu to see a variety of data about the collected bacteria.
