## Project Purpose
Create a panel for demographic information then create a way to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Viewers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species found in the volunteers. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
